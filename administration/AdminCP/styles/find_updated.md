vBulletin's default templates are often updated during upgrades. During this process the system will automatically try to merge any customizations into the new defaults. Should this merge fail, the template will be listed here. As the administrator, you will be able to compare your old version with the new version to make any necessary changes. You can choose to modify or revert a template if it is listed. If you select revert, your customizatized template will be deleted from the system and the default will be used.

If the page displays no modified templates then all your templates are up to date.
