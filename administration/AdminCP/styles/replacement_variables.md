Replacement variables are useful in representing commonly used values in styles and user content. They allow you to easily replace content items from users and in page text in a finished page output. Use the Styles & Templates > Replacement Variable Manager group to add / modify / delete replacement variables.
Note:

The Replacement Variable Manager lists all of your styles, together with any replacement variables defined within them. This allows you to see at a glance the way in which any replacement variables you have defined are being inherited by child styles.
