Within the Content Manager you can perform bulk actions on your articles and other content types within the CMS. There are more options to manage individual articles in the publicly viewable front-end of the CMS. Edit the article to view them.


The checkbox to the left of each article name is used to select an article. You can use this to apply a single action to multiple articles at the same time. The actions are chosen at the top of the page. To save a change to different articles, you would select the articles, chose the action at the top of the screeen and then click on the <APPLY> button.

Publishing an article will make it viewable to users. To publish an article, select the checkbox beside the article and click the <Published> button.

Un-publishing an article will make it invisible to users. To un-publish an article, select the checkbox beside the article and click the <Un-publish> button.

To delete an article, select the checkbox beside the article you want to delete and click the <Delete> button. A popup confirmation appears. Click the <Ok> button.

To edit an article and its contents, click on the <Edit> button to the right of the article. This opens the article form where you can make and save your changes to the article.

To change the order that articles appear in on the main page, fill in the display order box and click the <Save Display Order Button>

You can filter articles by a number of different options including category, content type, author, published status, tags and more. This is done at the top of the page. First you would select a filter and then you can select any options in the second dropdown. After you've made your selections click the <Filter> button.
