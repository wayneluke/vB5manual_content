 Moderators are users who are put in charge of maintaining one or more channels. Moderators are appointed by the vBulletin Administrator . Moderator responsibilities include deleting offensive or inappropriate posts, pruning old threads, and banning users from their channels. Moderator responsibilities are “assigned” to moderators through permissions. These are accessed under Channel Management → Moderator Permissions.

The Administrator can assign a moderator to a single channel by adding them in the Channel Manager screen. Administrators can also create Super Moderators by setting the user's primary usergroup to Super Moderator in the User Manager.

Placing a user in the Moderator usergroup is only for organization. The default permissions of this group do not apply any actual Moderator functionality.
