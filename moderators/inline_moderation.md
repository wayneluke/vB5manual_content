Inline thread moderation allows moderators and administrators to edit topics and replies easily from the Forum or Topic that they are currently viewing.

## Channel Topic Moderation

To access the inline moderation for topics open a forum page, and click on the Topics tab, if not already selected. A list of topics is displayed. Each topic has a checkbox at the end of the row. Selecting the checkbox adds the topic to the list of topics to be moderated. The topic will be highlighted to signify that the topic has been chosen.

Once you have selected the topics that you want to work with, select the moderation menu as indicated by the image below.

Then choose the action that you wish to complete. All selected topics will have the action applied to them.

Selecting the checkbox to the right of the Moderation Menu Control will select all topics on the current page.

## Individual Topics

When you enter a Topic, there are two different Inline Moderations tools. One allows you to perform moderation options on the topic. The other is for moderating multiple posts within the topic.

### Topic Moderation

If you enter a single topic, you can perform all topic moderation actions on it from the Topic Moderation Menu.

Topic moderation has many the same actions as listed above under Channel Topic Moderation. However they only affect the correct topic and the selection options have been removed.

### Post Moderation

If you enter or view a specific topic, you gain access to the Post Moderation icon. This allows you to treat individual posts as a group similarly to how topics are handled on the Forum page.
