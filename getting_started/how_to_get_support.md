As a vBulletin user there are going to be times where you run into problems that you don’t know how to fix. Knowing where to locate helpful guides, get support from the community and support staff is vital to the operation of your forum.

Depending on your license type or extra support contracts will enable you to get help in different ways. There are a few ways to receive support and they are as follows:

- **[The vBulletin.com Support Forums](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum)**: The support forums found on vBulletin.com provide peer to peer support. Support staff members are also available and respond to issues as soon as they’re available.

- **[The vBulletin.com Ticket system](https://members.vbulletin.com/membersupport_contactform.php)**: The support ticket system can be used for urgent and private issues. Your usage of the members area for support issues depends on your license type. If you have questions please feel free to ask.

- **Phone support**: This service is available from 9AM to 4PM (Pacific Standard Time) with a active phone support contract. You receive one on one support from a member of the Technical Support Staff.

If you’re having an issue with the software and are contacting support you should include as much information as possible in order to help resolve the issue as quickly as possible. You should provide the error message you’re getting, and any other information such as the steps you took to produce the error if any. Providing these items should help you to get your issue resolved as quickly as possible.

If you're having an issue with a third party modification or customization to the software, you will not be able to receive support from the Official vBulletin support systems. You will need to contact the author of the modification or visit [vBulletin.org](http://www.vbulletin.org/) for peer based assistance.
