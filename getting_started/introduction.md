## What is vBulletin?

vBulletin is a Community Driven Content Management System. vBulletin Connect is a community platform with content that is contributed by your end users. The system allows you to build custom community sites without coding. Community driven content management allows for content that is always fresh and relevent. Using vBulletin allows you to engage your users in content creation, collation and distribution. vBulletin 5 has been designed to bring you modern community building and ease of use.

 ## Self-Hosted vs. vBulletin Cloud

 There are two different ways that you can utilize vBulletin on your site. These are the Self-Hosted and vBulletin Cloud installations. There are pros and cons to either implementation.

 - [Self-Hosted](https://www.vbulletin.com/en/features): This installation type requires more technical knowledge on your part. You will be responsible for maintaining your server, upgrading vBulletin and the overall security of your server. In exchange for these requirements, you will have full access to the source code, can modify all templates, and install third-party products.
 - [vBulletin Cloud](https://www.vbulletin.com/en/vbulletin-cloud): When using the Cloud version of vBulletin, you won't have to worry about server maintenance, server security, or upgrading vBulletin. However, the tradeoff is that you won't be able to customize the software as much. People who run vBulletin Cloud sites, cannot edit most templates, upload third-party products, or access the source code the site.

### Everything is Content

actual content. In this model everything works the same, everything is searchable and everything provides a modern input system. Adding new
content should be more intuitive for your users.
