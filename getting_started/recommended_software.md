This manual makes reference to and shows screenshots of various programs that we use outside of the vBulletin software. This section covers software we recommend for use that is tried and tested in working with vBulletin.

## Text Editors
There may be times in vBulletin where you’ll be required to edit or make changes to PHP, html or JS files. Most operating systems come with one or more text editors. However, you may need more functionality than those basic applications. Here are some text editors that we recommend.  

[*Microsoft Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - {{< icon "windows" >}} {{< icon "apple" >}} {{< icon "linux" >}}
:   This is a robust text editor with many extensions and color themes available. It uses the Electron platform as its base and is available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

:   Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. 

[*Notepad++*](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - {{< icon "windows" >}}
:   Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages.

[*GNU Nano*](https://www.nano-editor.org/download.php) - {{< icon "linux" >}}
:   Nano is an easy to use text editor especially for both new and advanced Linux users. It enhances usability by providing customizable key binding.


## SFTP Client
While using vBulletin you’re going to need a way to get files onto your server, for this you will need an FTP Client. Most operating systems come with a command line FTP utility. However, you might want to use something with a GUI.

[*Filezilla*](http://filezilla-project.org/) - {{< icon "windows" >}} {{< icon "apple" >}} {{< icon "linux" >}}
:   Filezilla is a full featured FTP client that is capable of running on all modern operating systems. If you do not have a specific ftp client you like already, Filezilla ends up being the best choice for features, functionality, and cost.

[*CyberDuck*](https://cyberduck.io/) - {{< icon "windows" >}} {{< icon "apple" >}}
:   Cyberduck is a libre FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, S3, Backblaze B2, Azure & OpenStack Swift browser for Mac and Windows.

:   WinSCP is an open source free SFTP client, FTP client, WebDAV client and SCP client for Windows. Its main function is file transfer between a local and a remote computer. Beyond this, WinSCP offers scripting and basic file manager functionality.

## SSH
SSH allows you to connect to the terminal of your server. This is another utility that is available on most modern operating systems.

[*Putty SSH*](http://www.putty.org/) - {{< icon "windows" >}}
:   PuTTY is an SSH and telnet client, developed originally by Simon Tatham for the Windows platform. PuTTY is open source software that is available with source code and is developed and supported by a group of volunteers.

:   vSSH is advanced customizable SSH and Telnet client with iCloud connections and macros sharing.

## MySQL / MariaDB Access
vBulletin stores all of its data in a MySQL or MariaDB database. Being able to access the database directly allows you to create or restore backups and could be useful for fixing some issues. Your server's MySQL or MariaDB installation will come with a command-line tool that allows access via SSH. If you do not have SSH, then you'll want to use one of these tools.

[*MySQL Workbench*](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) - {{< icon "windows" >}} {{< icon "apple" >}} {{< icon "linux" >}}

MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more. MySQL Workbench is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. This requires remote access for your database server.

[*HeidiSQL*](http://www.heidisql.com/) - {{< icon "windows" >}}
:   HeidiSQL is a useful and reliable tool designed for web developers using the popular MySQL server, Microsoft SQL databases and PostgreSQL.

## Remote Access GUI
