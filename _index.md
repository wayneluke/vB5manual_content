Welcome to the vBulletin 5 Connect manual! This guide shows you how to get started creating community-driven content, including how to use vBulletin's tools to create a fully custom website. 

This documentation is organized into a series of chapters that will explain the functionality of the different areas that make up the vBulletin Package. Throughout this manual we will provide screenshots and in depth tutorials so that you spend more time running your community than you do building it. vBulletin Connect has been designed to bring you modern community building tools and ease of use.
