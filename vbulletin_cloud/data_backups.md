## Automatic Backups
The cloud system will automatically back up your database nightly. We retain 30 days of backup. If you need a backup restored, contact [vBulletin Support](https://www.vbulletin.com/en/contacts/). Restoring a backup will undo any changes made after the backup was created.

## Off-site Backups.
You can request a backup of your site data. This includes the database, attachments, avatars, smilies, and other customized data. To request a backup, visit your [Member's Area](https://members.vbulletin.com) and click the link to the right of your license information. Once the backup is created we will email you FTP credentials to download the backups. These backups are available for 48 hours after they are created. After that time, they will be deleted.
