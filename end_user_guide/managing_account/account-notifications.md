<p>You may manage your notification settings by going to your username in the upper right corner > click to get the drop down > select User Settings.  On that page, select the Notifications tab.  One this page, you may select your Email Notifications (turn it on, make it daily or weekly, or choose to get it through the message center only).  You may also set what type of Notifications you would like to receive.</p>
