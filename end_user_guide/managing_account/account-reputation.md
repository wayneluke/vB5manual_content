<p>Reputation is a way of rating users depending on the quality of their posts. If the administrators have enabled reputation, then the like icon will be visible in posts.</p>

<p>You can build your reputation on the site by posting informative and constructive content. This in turn will encourage people to follow your posts, press the like button on different posts and they could even subscribe to your content.</p>

<h2>How do I give reputation?</h2>
<p>To give reputation, click on the like icon in the relevant post. This will signify you like the content and will add to the user's reputation. If you click on the like icon again, you will remove that reputation from the user.</p>

<h2>How do I know what reputation I have received?</h2>
<p>You will be notified when someone likes one of your posts. In addition to this, your general reputation will appear within the user information of your posts. These show as small graphics or pips under your Avatar. As your reputation inceases, the number of pips or graphics will increase.</p>

<h2>How much reputation is given? What is reputation power?</h2>
<p>If the administrator has enabled this, the amount of reputation that each user will give (or take away if negative) is shown in the user's posts as 'Reputation Power'. The value of the reputation power is determined by the administrator and may increase over time depending on the settings they have applied.</p>

<h2>What if I don't want anyone to see my reputation?</h2>
You can disable the display of your reputation by going to your <a href="settings/account">Account Settings</a> and selecting the checkbox for Reputation Level.</p>
