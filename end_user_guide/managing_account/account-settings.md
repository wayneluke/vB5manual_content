<p>You can change your account settings by clicking on your username in the top right corner of the vBulletin site. This will provide a dropdown menu. From here select "User Settings".</p>
<p>On the settings page, you will see up to five tabs. Profile, Settings, Privacy, Notifications and Subscriptions. These are:</p>
<div class="restore">
<ul>
	<li>Profile - This is the public information that is shown to everyone. You can control who sees your information on the <a class="faq-link" href="./help#account_overview/account_privacy" data-group="account_overview" data-item="account_privacy" data-path="account_overview/account_privacy">Privacy</a> tab.</li>
	<li>Account - This tab contains the settings for your account and allows you some control over how things are presented to you on the system.</li>
	<li>Privacy - This allows you to control who has access to your information.</li>
	<li>Notifications - This tab controls how you are notified of new content you are interested in.</li>
        <li>Subscriptions - If subscriptions are available for purchase, they will be managed here. You can purchase new subscriptions or cancel existing ones. Subscriptions can provide additional permissions, enhanced posting rights or simply be a way of supporting the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>There may be additional tabs depending on your permissions and site offerings.</p>
