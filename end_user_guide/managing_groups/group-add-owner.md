<p>Additional owners can be assigned to a group and will allow them to review pending joined group requests, subscriber requests and posts. To add additional owners, navigate to the group you'd like to add these users too and then hover over the 'Administrative' click. From the dropdown that appears, click 'Manage Group Managers'.</p>

<p>A new page will appear showing a text field where additional owners can be added to the group in question. Simply type in the usernames for the additional owners, then click 'Add' and your changes will be saved.</p>

<p>In addition to this, you are able to see who currently owns the group and any other additional owners of the group. You are also able to transfer your ownership to another user.</p>
