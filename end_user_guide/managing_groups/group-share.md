<p>When creating your new Group, you can set the Permissions and Privacy for the Group. These are presented in three options.
<div class="restore"><ul>
<li>Group Type - This controls how people join. You can set it so anyone can join, that join requests are moderated by you, or require that you invite them before they can join.</li>
<li>Permissions & Privacy - set who may view your Group and leave comments - Everyone, Group Members Only, or Group Members & Registered Users</li>
<li>Can Post - This controls who can post to the group. You can set this to Group Members Only or Allow Group Members and all Registered Users on the site to post.</li>
</ul></div>

<p>After your group has been created, you can update these settings at any time by visiting the group on the site and clicking on "Administrative" in the top right corner. Select "General Settings" and you can update the settings above.</p>
