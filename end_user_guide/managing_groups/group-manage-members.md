<p>If you wish to invite members to join your Group, you would need to go to the main Group page and on the right side is an Administrative dropdown menu. From there, select 'Invite Members' and on the right, there will be a text area with the heading 'Enter User Names'. You may enter the usernames here separated by commas and then click 'Save Changes'. Once these members accept your invitation, they will show up on the 'Manage Joined Members' list.</p>
