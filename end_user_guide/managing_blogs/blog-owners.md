<p>If you wish to share ownership of your Blog, you would go to the main Blog page and on the right side under Blog Summary there is an
Administrative dropdown menu.  Go to that menu and select Manage Contributors.  On the right side of that page is a text area next to
the heading "Add Moderator".  You may enter the other user's username, hit tag to get it accepted and then click Add.  They will then show up on that same page under Current List with a Status of Pending. That user will then get a Notification asking them to Accept or Ignore your request to be a Moderator of that Blog.  If they accept, the status will be changed to Active.  You would still be the owner, but they will be listed as a Contributor.</p>
