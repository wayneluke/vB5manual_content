<p>To create a new blog, just go to the Blogs tab and right underneath the Blogs tab in the main navigation is the option to Create a New Blog.  Once you click that link, you will be on the General Settings page and be able to set some options for your new Blog:</p>
<div class="restore"><ul>
<li>Title - your Blog title. Create as fancy of a title that you want.</li>
<li>Description - a short description of your Blog. Tell others what your blog is about. </li>
<li>Blog Icon - you may upload an icon to show on your Blog</li>
<li>Options - set some default options for your Blog</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Once you edit those settings, you can click Publish and your Blog will be created.</p>
