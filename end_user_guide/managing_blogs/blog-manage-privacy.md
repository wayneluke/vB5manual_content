<p>To decide who may view and comment on your Blog, you would go to the main Blog page and on the right side under Blog Summary is an
Administrative dropdown menu.  Go to that menu and select Permissions& Privacy.  On this page, you may set the following:</p>
<div class="restore"><ul>
<li>Default Entry Options - you may set whether Comments are allowed by default (you may change this per each entry when it is created) and whether you wish to Moderate the Comments</li>
<li>Subscriber requests - set whether to auto-accept subscribers or require approval.</li>
<li>Permissions & Privacy - set who may view your blog and leave comments - Everyone, Subscribers, or Subscribers & Registered Users</li>
</ul></div>
