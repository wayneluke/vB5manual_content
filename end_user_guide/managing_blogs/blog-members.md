<p>If you wish to invite members to subscribe to your Blog, you would go to the main Blog page and on the right side under Blog Summary is an Administrative dropdown menu.  Go to that menu and select Invite Members.  On the right side of that page is a text area next to the
heading "Enter User Names".  You may enter other user's usernames separated by a comma and then hit the Save and Publish button on the
bottom.  Once they accept your request, they will then show up on the Manage Contributors list.</p>
