<p>You may create a new photo album in one of two ways:</p>
<div class="restore"><ul>
<li>You may create a new topic on a channel you have permission to do so and share photos to create an album.</p>
<li>You may go to your profile and click on the MEDIA tab.  There you will be given the option to add photos (or videos.) Choose the Add Photos link and you will be presented with the familiar editor and you can share photos as in other site posts.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The maximum number of images you can upload into an album, and the maximum size of images, both in file size and dimension, are set by the site administrator.</p>
<p>After you have created an album you may add additional photos at any time.</p>
