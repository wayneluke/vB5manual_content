<p>Video albums are not supported at this time. However if you go to your profile and click the MEDIA tab there will be a Videos album. If you click on the Videos album you will see a list of all videos you previously attached to posts on the site. This allows for a quick way for you or others to see the videos that you have shared in the past.</p>

<p>Note: If you haven't attached any videos you will not see the Videos album.</p>
