<p>If you have previously uploaded a photo you may reuse it in a photo post  or photo album without uploading it again.</p>
<p>Whether you are adding photos to a new album, an existing album, or to a new topic besides the Upload option you will also see a Select from Photo Album option.  </p>
<p>Click this button and you will be presented with a list of your photo albums on one side and the thumbnail images of photos from that album on the other side.</p>
<p>Choose one or more images by clicking the checkbox in the top corner of each thumbnail you wish to reuse.</p>
<p>Press Continue when complete. You can then upload additional new photos or Continue again. </p>
<p>At this point your reused photos will now be added to your post, topic, album, or other content you are creating.</p>
