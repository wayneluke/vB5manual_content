<p>If you have previously created a photo album you may add additional photos by going to your profile and clicking on the MEDIA tab.  You will see all existing albums. Click on the thumbnail or title of the album you wish to add photos to.</p>
<p>The album will open. Press the Add Photos button.  On the new window press the Upload More button to get the file selection dialog box.  Choose one or more files as usual to upload.</p>
<p>After the files upload you will see thumbnails of the new photos as well as existing photos in the album.</p>
<p>If you uploaded any pictures by mistake or otherwise wish to remove any, bring the mouse pointer over the thumbnail and a trashcan icon will appear in the bottom corner. Click the icon to remove that image from the album. </p>
<p>When you are done click Save to finalize the changes.</p>
