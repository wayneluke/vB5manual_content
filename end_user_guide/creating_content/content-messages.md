<p>If the administrator has enabled the Private Messaging system, registered members may send each other private messages.</p>

<h2>How do I send a message to another user?</h2>
<p>This site uses a Private Message (or PM) system to allow users to send messages to each other if the Administrator has given you permission to do so. Private messages work a little like email, but are limited to registered members of this site. You may be able to include BB code, smilies and images in private messages that you send. Note the word "Private" is used because only the user(s) you send the message to will get notice and be able to read or respond to the message, however, the data itself is not encrypted so you should not consider PMs truly private.</p>
<p>To start a new Private Message click on Messages at the top of the page and then press the Compose New button.</p>
<p>An alternative way is to browse to a user's profile page and press the Private Message button visible on the ACTIVITIES page.  If you start a message this way the username will already be in the "To" box on the next page.</p>
<p>You may add one or more names to the "To" box by pasting in a full username or by typing in a username. If typing the system will show you usernames that begin with the letters you've typed after you've entered at least 3 characters. Either select the username from this list or finish typing it out. Press the "Enter" key when you've typed out a full name for it to be saved as a recipient to the message. You may remove a recipient by clicking the small X icon next to any recipient added.</p>
<p>The site Administrator will determine the maximum number of recipients you may send to.
After you've selected the recipient(s) of the message you may type a subject and message. </p>
<p>Press Send when you are ready to send the message or Cancel to discard the message.</p>
