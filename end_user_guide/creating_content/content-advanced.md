<p>When posting messages you may wish to include some formatting such as <b>bold</b> text, <i>italic</i> text or <span style="text-decoration:underline">underline</span> text.</p>
<p>Adding formatting to a post can be done in either of two ways:</p>
<div class="restore">
<ul>
<li>Using clickable buttons in the Advanced editor similar to those found in word processors</li>
<li>Typing in BB Codes around text manually</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Clickable buttons are available in the Advanced editor. Click on the A icon in the editor to toggle the Advanced editor controls.</p>
<p>To use clickable buttons simply click the button, for example the B (bold) button and then type to get bold text. Click the button again to stop using that formatting. You can also highlight text that you have already typed then click the formatting button to format existing text. Some buttons like the one for inserting images provide for more advanced options such as formatting controls and upload options. </p>
<p>BB Code is a special set of codes similar to HTML that can be used in posts. BBCodes are formatted in one of two ways:</p>
<p>Simple BB Code like bold text consist of just an opening and closing tag: [B]Example[/B] becomes <b>Example</b>.</p>
<p>Advanced BB Codes use an option in addition to an opening and closing tag. URL BB Code is an example of an advanced BB Code.<br /> [URL=http://www.vbulletin.com]Link to vBulletin[/URL] becomes <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com" target="_blank">Link to vBulletin</a>. In this example the vBulletin.com URL is the option.</p>
<p>Site Administrators may create custom BB Codes in addition to the built in BB Codes with buttons in the Advanced editor. </p>
