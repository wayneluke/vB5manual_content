<p>You may post links or videos in any forum, group, or blog for which you have permission to do so. If you see the "Post Link" button, represented by a paperclip icon, in the editor toolbar you may click on it either when creating a new topic or posting a reply. </p>
<p>After clicking on Post Link button in the editor you will have the standard message box as well as an additional URL field that begins with http://. Enter or paste in the full URL to either a web page or video. </p>
<p>If you enter the URL of a web page and press the Add Link button the software will scan the page and grab the page title, short meta description, as well as present one or more images to use as possible thumbnails. You may use the left or right arrows to browse the available thumbnail images or check the appropriate box to not include a thumbnail at all. </p>
<p>You may edit the site title or description by clicking the little pencil icon next to each. If you wish to cancel the link press the Remove Link link.</p>
<p>If you wish to share a video from a popular site such as YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, or Metacafe you can use the Post Link feature to link to a video URL. When you put the URL of a video from any of these sites in the input field and click Add Link, the video itself will be embedded in the page instead of a small thumbnail image. You will still get the title and description of the video and you may still edit these values in the same way with the pencil icons next to each. </p>
<p>Whether you've attached a link with a thumbnail or a video to the message you can complete the post by pressing Post or Post Reply to share the link or video.</p>
