<p>A new topic is the evolution of what previously were called new threads in earlier versions. A topic in a forum or group can hold one or more posts of various content types such traditional text based posts, shared pictures, links or videos, or polls. </p>
<p>To create a new topic click on the +New Topic button when browsing a forum or group.
You will be presented with a screen where you must give a title (or subject) of the topic and optionally choose a topic prefix if available. A topic prefix will appear before the title and will contain a list of one or more prefixes chosen by the site administrator to better categorize your topic. Clicking on a thread prefix in forum view will show a list of topics with the same prefix.</p>
<p>Underneath the title, you will see six icons representing your content and editing choices:</p>
<div class="restore"><ul>
<li>Camera - Choosing the camera will open an interface where you can upload one or more photos and create a Gallery topic.</li>
<li>Link - Choosing the Link icon will allow you to share a Link or Video from external site in order to discuss this item. Only one link is allow per post.</li>
<li>Graph - This allows you to start a new poll on the site. Unlike all the other options a poll can only be inserted as the first post in a topic. Choosing to insert poll will allow you to ask a poll question and provide 2 or more options for users to vote on.</li>
<li>A (underlined)- Advanced Editor. This will open the Advanced Editing toolbar directly over your post. This allows you to easily apply formatting and other BBCode. </li>
<li>Smiley - Opens the smilie manager under your post. Clicking on individual smilies will insert them into the post at the cursor location.</li>
<li>File (with paperclip) - Opens up the attachment interface. This will allow you to attach allowed file formats to your post in order to share them with others.
</ul></div>
<p>You may also have the option to add tags to the topic. Tags are optional keywords that  describe the topic. Click on the Tags +  link to add tags. Press enter after each tag you enter. You may also click on popular tags to add them. Press the X icon next to any tag to remove it.  Press Save when done adding tags or cancel to discard the tags.</p>
<p>When you have completed your post you may preview or post the new content. Upon pressing Post a new topic will be created.</p>
