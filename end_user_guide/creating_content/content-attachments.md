<p>You may have permission to attach files and images to your posts on this site. If you have permission you will see a paper with paperclip icon on the editor- pressing this button will bring up the Upload Attachment option.</p>
<p>File attachments may be data files such as .zip, .txt, .doc, or any other file types the Administrator has allowed. You may also attach images (.jpg, .png. and .gif.)</p>
<p>To upload a file press the Upload Attachment button after you have clicked on the paper-clip icon at the top to show the button.</p>
<p>You will be shown a file selection dialog box. Browse to find the file(s) you wish to upload. You may use standard SHIFT+Click or CTRL+Click shortcuts to attach multiple files. The Administrator can specify the maximum number of files you may attach per post.
If attaching data files a hyperlink with the file name will be inserted into the post. If attaching an image the actual image will be inserted into the post.</p>
<p>If you have not reached the maximum number of files you may press the Upload Attachments button again to upload additional files.
To remove attachments simply delete them from the editor.</p>
<p>When you have completed the post submit it as normal and your file(s) will be attached to your post.</p>
