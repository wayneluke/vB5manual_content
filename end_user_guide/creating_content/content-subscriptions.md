<p>Above each discussion or topic, there is a Subscribe toggle. Clicking on this will enable you to follow the discussion easier. Each time someone replies to the discussion, you will get a notification that will show on your Messages page. You can follow these notifications to the new content or delete them from the Notifications area on your Messages Page.</p>

<p>If you wish to no longer follow a discussion or topic, then clicking on the button again will turn off your subscription.</p>
