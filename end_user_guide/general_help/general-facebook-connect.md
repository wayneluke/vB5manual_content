<p>Facebook Connect is an optional vBulletin feature that, if enabled, allows for quicker registrations by automatically using information from your existing Facebook account on this site. If you have previously registered you may use Facebook Connect to link your site account with your Facebook profile.</p>
<p>You may add or sever the Facebook link at any time by going to your username at the top of the page, and choosing "User Settings." Next click on the "Accounts" tab and finally scroll down to "Facebook Connect" and you may connect or disconnect from Facebook.</p>
