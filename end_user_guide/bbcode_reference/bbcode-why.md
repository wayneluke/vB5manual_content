Users often want to create rich and featured documents on the web. Unfortunately there are limitations to this due to how the Web works. In order to protect the users of this site, vBulletin implements BB Code. These codes allows you to create exciting content without worrying about the people who may not be working in your best interest. BBCode doesn't allow others to embed tools to steal cookies, implant viruses on your machine and prevents other security issues from happening. In short, the BBCode serves multiple purposes. It allows you to fully express yourself and it provides security for your information from others.

## Why is a specific tag unavailable?

The adminstrator of your site can control what tags are available. This is based on what they determined the needs of the site are. If the site administrator turns off a tag, it will simply not be rendered.

## Wouldn't allowing HTML be easier?
Yes, it would be easier actually. However keeping your personal information safe is important that BB Code has been implemented.
